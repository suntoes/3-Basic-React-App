# 3 Basic React App
## A showcase of my 3 small project w/ react from FreeCodeCamp
1. Drum Machine
   - 9 drum pads and adjustable volume
   - Kinda boring
    
2. 25 + 5 Clock 
   - Adjustable break and session length and mutable click sfx
   - Sketchiest ui
    
3. Calculator
   - 4 basic arithmetic operation with decimals
   - Too common
